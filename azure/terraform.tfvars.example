# This is the very minimum variables example file. You have to put Azure-related login variables, validator keys from Polkadot, and a content of your SSH public key that will be used to connect to the instance. For the full list of supported variables see variables.tf file in the root directory of this repo.

## Can be omitted if you are logged into Azure CLI (use `az login` command)
# azure_subscription = ""
# azure_client = ""
# azure_client_secret = ""
# azure_tenant = ""
## Resource group to create resources at
azure_rg = "Web3"

## To get the instance type `az vm list-skus --location $REGION --output table` command, where region is each of the 3 regions you will install failover validator at.
## By default regions are: centralus, eastus, westus.
## Find SKU that is available at each of the selected region
