# This is the very minimum variables example file. You have to put JSON private key for your GCP account, validator keys from Polkadot, and a content of your SSH public key that will be used to connect to the instance. For the full list of supported variables see variables.tf file in the root directory of this repo.

## You can skip setting gcp_ variables and set environment variables instead (GOOGLE_APPLICATION_CREDENTIALS and GOOGLE_PROJECT)
# Path to the JSON private key to your GCP account
gcp_credentials = ""
# Name of the project at GCP
gcp_project     = ""

# Validator-related variables
